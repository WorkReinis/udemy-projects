## üìö Udemy Course Projects

This repository contains coding projects and exercises completed while following various Udemy web development courses.  

The projects are primarily built using **Create React App** or **Vite**, and focus on practical implementation of front-end fundamentals.  
Although most are small and experimental, they mark important milestones in my learning journey.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è _Note: These are not production-grade apps, but small exercises meant for skill development._

The projects cover topics such as:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals
- DOM manipulation and events
- Responsive design
- API usage and async JavaScript
- React basics and component-based architecture
